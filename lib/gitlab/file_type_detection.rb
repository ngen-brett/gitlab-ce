# The method `filename` must be defined in classes that use this module.
#
# This module is intended to be used as a helper and not a security gate
# that validates that a file is safe, as it identifies files only by the
# file extension and not its actual contents.
#
# For example, a valid use of this module is in `FileMarkdownLinkBuilder` which
# renders markdown depending on a file name.
#
# In some workflows we don't have the content of the file to detect the
# real content type. For example, in scenarios where the user can use git,
# files won't go through our analyzers.
#
# In order to mitigate this we use Workhorse to detect the real extension
# when we serve files with the `SendsBlob` helper methods, and ask Workhorse
# to set the content type when it serves the file:
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/33e5955/app/helpers/workhorse_helper.rb#L48.
#
# Because Workhorse has access to the content when it is downloaded, if
# the type/extension doesn't match the real type, we adjust the
# Content-Type and Content-Disposition to the one we get from the detection.
