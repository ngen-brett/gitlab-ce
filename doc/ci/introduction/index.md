# Introduction to CI/CD with GitLab

On this document we'll present an overview of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, and an introduction to GitLab CI/CD.

<!-- TBA: PM's introductory video? -->

## Introduction to continuous methods

Read below an introduction to continuous methods of software develpment:

- [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration)
- [Continuous Delivery](#continuous-delivery)
- [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment)

### Continuous Integration

Consider an application in which its code is stored in a Git repository in GitLab. Developers push code changes every day, multiple times a day. For every push to the repository, you can create a set of scripts to build and test your application straightaway, decreasing the chance of introducing errors to your app.

This practice is known as [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration); for every change submitted to a given application, it's built and tested continuously, making sure the introduced changes pass all tests, guidelines, and code compliances you established for your app.

[GitLab itself](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce) is a practical example of using Continuous Integration as a software development method. For every push to the project, there's a set of scripts the code is checked against.

### Continuous Delivery

[Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/) is a step forward after Continuous Integration with which you not only build and test your application at every code change pushed to your application's codebase, but, as an additional step, you also deploy it continuously, but the deployment is triggered manually.

This method ensures the code is checked automatically but requires someone to manually and strategically trigger the deployment of the changes.

> Continuous Delivery is a software engineering approach in which Continuous Integration, automated testing, and automated deployment capabilities allow software to be developed and deployed rapidly, reliably and repeatedly with minimal human intervention.

### Continuous Deployment

[Continuous Deployment](https://www.airpair.com/continuous-deployment/posts/continuous-deployment-for-practical-people) is also a step forward after Continuous Integration, on the light of Continuous Delivery. The difference is that instead of deploying your application manually, you set it up so that the deployment is also triggered automatically.

> Continuous Deployment is a software development practice in which every code change goes through the entire pipeline and is put into production automatically, resulting in many production deployments every day. It does everything that Continuous Delivery does, but the process is fully automated, with no human intervention at all.

## Introduction to GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD is a powerful tool built into GitLab that allows you to apply all the continuous methods (Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment) to your softare with no third-party integration needed.

### How GitLab CI/CD works

To use GitLab CI/CD, all you need is an application hosted in a Git repository and configure your build, test, and deployment scripts in a file called [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](../yaml/README.md), placed at the root of your repository.

In this file, you define the scripts you want to run, include and cache dependencies, choose what commands you want to run in sequence and those you want to run in parallel, define where you want to deploy your app to, choose if you want to run the script automatically or if you want to trigger it manually. Once you're familiar with GitLab CI/CD you can add more advanced steps into the configuration file.

To add scripts to that file, you'll need to organize them in a sequence that suits your application and are in accordance with the tests you wish to perform. To visualize the process, imagine that all the scripts you add to the configuration file are the same as the commands you run on a terminal in your computer.

Once you've added your configuration file `.gitlab-ci.yml` to your repository, GitLab will identify it and run your scripts with the tool called [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/), which works similarly to your terminal.

GitLab CI/CD not only executes the scripts you've set but shows you what's happening, as you would see in your terminal.

You create the strategy for your app and GitLab runs the pipeline for you according to what you've set. Your pipeline status is also displayed by GitLab:

At the end, if anything goes wrong, you can easily [roll back](../environments.md#rolling-back-changes) all the changes.

### Basic CI/CD Workflow

A very simple workflow for using GitLab CI/CD could be:

- Create an issue to discuss an implementation.
- Submit your changes on a merge request in a feature branch.
- Run automated scripts (sequential or parallel).
  - Build, test and deploy to a staging environment.
  - Preview the changes with Review Apps.
- Get your code reviewed and approved.
- Merge the feature branch into the default branch.
  - Deploy your changes automatically to a production environment.
-  Roll it back if something goes wrong.

GitLab CI/CD is capable of a doing a lot more, but this workflow exemplifies the ability GitLab has to track the entire process, without the need of any external tool to deliver your software. And, most interestingly, you can visualize all the steps through the GitLab UI.

### GitLab CI/CD feature set

<!-- (maybe link back to the index instead of listing everything here again?) -->

- Easily set everything up with [Auto DevOps](../../topics/autodevops/index.md).
- Deploy static websites with [GitLab Pages](../../user/project/pages/index.md).
- Deploy your app to different [environments](../environments.md).
- Preview changes per merge request with [Review Apps](../review_apps/index.md).
- Develop secure and private Docker images with [Container Registry](../../user/project/container_registry.md).
- Install your own [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).
- [Schedule pipelines](../../user/project/pipelines/schedules.md).
- Check the app vulnerability with [Security Test reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/#security-reports-ultimate). **[ULTIMATE]**
